## Overview

This is a desktop application that visualizes the direction field (slope field) of first-order differential equations of the form: **dy/dx = f(x, y)**

The user can input a function f(x, y), and the app dynamically renders the corresponding direction field.
You can try some of the following equations: 
- **-x / y**
- **y - y\*\*3**
- **sin(x * y)**
- **x*y**


The mathematical significance and interpretative value of sketching direction fields are discussed in detail in the accompanying document:
